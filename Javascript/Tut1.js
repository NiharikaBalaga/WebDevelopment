//1. Ending statements with semicolon is not required, but highly recommended.

var a, b, c;     // Declare 3 variables
a = 5;           // Assign the value 5 to a
b = 6;           // Assign the value 6 to b
c = a + b;       // Assign the sum of a and b to c

//2. When separated by semicolons, multiple statements on one line are allowed:
a = 5; b = 6; document.write("<h1>Hello World</h1>") ;
